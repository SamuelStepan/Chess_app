This is my first bigger project. I have created chess app for 2 players, on the right side you can see some info (like which player's turn it is, or what move was played), you can also load game you have already played, 
you can find all game saves in folder "saves", just copy the name and to the entry widget and press button, then you can also choose to go back to some turn before (or just manually move to the next or previous turns 
using buttons). In order to run this app you must have installed all modules/libraries, then you can run main.py and enjoy the game. 
P.S. the code is really messy, when I was coding this project I didn't know that using global variables and nesting functions in other functions is not the best idea.
